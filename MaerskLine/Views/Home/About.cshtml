    Maersk Line is the global container division and the largest operating unit of the A.P.
    Moller – Maersk Group, a Danish business conglomerate. It is the world's largest container shipping company
    having customers through 374 offices in 116 countries. It employs approximately 7,000 sea farers and approximately
    25,000 land-based people. Maersk Line operates over 600 vessels and has a capacity of 2.6 million TEU.
    The company was founded in 1928.Operating in 100 countries and transporting goods around the globe, at first glance
    it would appear Danish shipping company Maersk Line is already handling all the cargo it can manage.
    In an effort to support further business growth and increase organizational flexibility, Maersk decided to consolidate
    all of its data centers and server rooms operating worldwide onto a virtualized platform. Microsoft Azure was already
    hosting some of Maersk’s IT environment, and in March 2016 Maersk initially approached Microsoft about expanding the
    scope of the relationship. Moving forward, Lorenzen says Maersk is currently changing over its IT setup based on Microsoft
    Azure, starting with the desktop environment up to container management.The Container Management System (CMS) is to cater to manage the containers,
    a solution that reduces overall supply chain costs and an efficient way to manage logistics.
